# EEG resources {.unnumbered}

One of the main modalities we use in our lab to study Human-robot interaction is EEG (others include EMG, haptics). Here are some resources which introduce you to the analysis of EEG and physiological signal processing in general.

## EEG Glossary

To understand EEG terminology and report formats, refer to the comprehensive glossary by clinical electroencephalographers: [EEG Glossary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2467981X17300215?via%3Dihub){target='_blank_'}.

## Setting up EEG Recordings

## EEG Analysis Steps
For those who are starting with EEG analysis, it can be overwhelming to go across a lot of steps. Here is almost a standard procedure for a lot of EEG analysis. Each block is a research area by itself. There are a lot of papers on each block. Do not get scared once you start the analysis of some EEG data, these steps will become second to your nature. Do read below given paper about how others are doing these steps. We use [mne-python](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/mne/stable/index.html){target='_blank_'} to implement different block functionalities. If you want more information, refer to [Mike X Cohen's lectures](https://www.youtube.com/@mikexcohen1){target='_blank_'}

## MNE (MNE-Python)

We extensively use [mne-python](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/mne/stable/index.html){target='_blank_'} for EEG data analysis. Resources to get you started:

- [Basic mne-python tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wmvanvliet/SNL_workshop_2019/master?filepath=SNL_workshop_2019.ipynb){target='_blank_'}
- [Intermediate tutorials](https://mne.tools/0.14/tutorials.html){target='_blank_'}
- Join the [mailing list](https://mail.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/mailman/listinfo/mne_analysis){target='_blank_'} for updates and community support.

## EEG Databases

Here are some databases on which you are apply your mne-python skills.

The best way to learn a (Python) package is to use it on your own data and see what are the capabilities
:::

Pick up some data from this repository: [meagmohit/EEG-Datasets](https://github.com/meagmohit/EEG-Datasets){target='_blank_'}. Use mne-python do some analysis and that is how you get introduced to analysis of EEG.
